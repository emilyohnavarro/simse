Welcome to the SimSE Code Inspection Simulation Game! You are the project manager leading a software project in the 
Scootie Software Company. Your particular task in this game is to direct your employees in conducting a code inspection.
You must choose the parameters of the inspection, namely, the number of people involved (and which people they are), 
the size of code to inspect, and the size of the checklist to use. You can also decide when the best stopping point is,
once you feel the inspection is no longer productive. (Note: One clock tick equals one minute.) 

It is important to note that you are only allowed one inspection per game. In other words, if you tell everyone to stop
inspecting, you will not have the chance to start another inspection within this game. You will instead have to start 
over.

You will receive a score at the end that is out of 100 points. It will be based on the ratio of the number of bugs you
found versus the total number of bugs originally present in the code. In other words, the more bugs you find, the better
your score will be. So try to choose your parameters efficiently! Good luck!
