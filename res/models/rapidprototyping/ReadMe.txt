Welcome to the SimSE Rapid Prototyping game!

You have been tasked with building an in-house inventory system for the babycenter.com online baby product store. Your customer is not entirely sure what they want the system to do or to look like, so unearthing their requirements might take a little bit of work and creativity. 

Your final score will be out of 100 and will be based on how well you use your time, the completeness of the final product (how many requirements you actually implement versus how many the customer had in mind), and the correctness of the final product. You can view these different score components at the end of the game by viewing your project attributes

Keep in mind that the most important aspect of this game is how well you perform the prototype / customer evaluation cycle. The rest of the life cycle after that should follow the waterfall model.
